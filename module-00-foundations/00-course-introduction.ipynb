    "## What this course is\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a self-paced course that starts with voltage, current, and resistance and ends with you being able to pick up any semiconductor datasheet and understand what it's telling you.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll understand:\n",
    "- What's physically happening inside a diode, transistor, or IC\n",
    "- Why components behave the way they do (not just *that* they do)\n",
    "- How to read a manufacturer's datasheet — every parameter, graph, and table\n",
    "- How to design basic circuits using real components\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is organized into **8 modules**, each building on the last:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Module | Topic | What you'll learn |\n",
    "|--------|-------|------------------|\n",
    "| **00** | Foundations | Voltage, current, resistance, power, Kirchhoff's laws, AC/DC |\n",
    "| **01** | Before Semiconductors | Conductors, insulators, and why vacuum tubes weren't enough |\n",
    "| **02** | PN Junctions | Doping, diodes, Zener diodes — your first datasheet drill |\n",
    "| **03** | BJT Transistors | NPN/PNP, switching, amplification, Darlington pairs |\n",
    "| **04** | MOSFETs | Field-effect transistors, MOSFET vs BJT tradeoffs |\n",
    "| **05** | Semiconductor Zoo | LEDs, photodiodes, voltage regulators, sensors |\n",
    "| **06** | Integrated Circuits | From transistors to logic gates, 74HC series |\n",
    "| **07** | Capstone | General datasheet methodology, independent project |"

    "## How the course works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Every lesson is a **Jupyter notebook** — the document you're reading right now. A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that mixes text, equations, code, and visualizations in a single file. You read it top to bottom, like a textbook chapter, but you can also *run* the code cells and see results immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never used Jupyter before, here's what you need to know:\n",
    "- **Markdown cells** (like this one) contain text, diagrams, and equations. You just read them.\n",
    "- **Code cells** (gray background, with `[ ]:` or `[1]:` on the left) contain Python code. Click on one and press **Shift+Enter** to run it. The output appears directly below.\n",
    "- Run cells **in order from top to bottom**. Later cells often depend on earlier ones (especially the first \"Setup\" cell).\n",
    "- You can **change the code** and re-run it. Experiment! Change a resistor value, re-run the cell, see what happens to the plot. You can't break anything — if things go wrong, just restart the kernel (`Kernel → Restart`) and run cells from the top again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code in this course is **not** a programming exercise — you don't need to understand how to write Python to learn the material. The code serves three purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visualization.** Plotting IV curves, power dissipation graphs, frequency responses, and other relationships that are much easier to understand as pictures than as equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation.** Working through the math for voltage dividers, bias points, filter frequencies, etc. — showing every step so you can verify your own hand calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactive exploration.** Some notebooks have sliders (using ipywidgets) that let you drag a value and watch the circuit response change in real time. This builds intuition faster than any textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to read the code — it's written to be clear, with comments explaining what each section does — but if you want to treat the code cells as black boxes that produce pictures and numbers, that works fine too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What each notebook covers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notebooks follow a consistent structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept** — The theory, explained in plain language with equations where needed\n",
    "- **The Material Science Why** — What's physically happening at the atomic level. This is what separates \"I memorized Ohm's law\" from \"I understand why materials resist current.\"\n",
    "- **Simulation** — Circuit simulations using [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/), a free browser-based simulator. You'll build circuits and see voltage/current flow animated in real time.\n",
    "- **Experiments** — Step-by-step physical builds using your equipment (multimeter, oscilloscope, bench supply, breadboard). You'll measure real voltages and currents and compare to predictions.\n",
    "- **Datasheet Connection** — Where the concept shows up on a real datasheet. This thread runs through every notebook and builds toward the datasheet drill exercises.\n",
    "- **Checkpoint Questions** — Self-test to confirm understanding before moving on."

    "## Your equipment\n",

    "- **Klein MM300 multimeter** — for measuring voltage, current, and resistance\n",
    "- **Fnirsi 2C53T oscilloscope + signal generator** — for visualizing waveforms and generating test signals (introduced in Module 00, used heavily from Module 02 onward)\n",

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "### First time setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management. From the repo root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv sync                              # install all dependencies\n",
    "MATPLOTLIBRC=. uv run jupyter lab    # launch Jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MATPLOTLIBRC=.` part tells matplotlib to use the project's configuration file, which keeps any generated image files out of the notebook directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to start\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `module-00-foundations/01-electrical-fundamentals.ipynb` and work through it. Each notebook ends by telling you what comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pace\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no schedule. Work through each notebook until you're comfortable with the checkpoint questions, then move on. Some notebooks will take an hour; some might take a weekend if you want to really explore the experiments and simulations. The goal is understanding, not speed."
