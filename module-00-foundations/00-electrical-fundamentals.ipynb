   "source": "---\n## 0. The Two Quantities You Need First: Energy and Charge\n\nBefore we define voltage, current, or anything else, we need two physical quantities that everything else is built from.\n\n### Joules — the unit of energy\n\nA **joule (J)** is the SI unit of energy. One joule is the energy needed to:\n- Lift a 100g apple about 1 meter against gravity\n- Light a 1W LED for 1 second\n- Push 1 ampere of current through 1 ohm of resistance for 1 second\n\nEnergy is the capacity to do work — to move something, heat something, or emit light. In electronics, energy is what a battery stores and what components consume. A AA battery holds roughly 9,000 joules. A lightning bolt delivers about 1 billion joules.\n\nThe key insight: **energy is conserved.** It cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. A battery converts chemical energy to electrical energy. A resistor converts electrical energy to heat. An LED converts it to light. This conservation principle is the physical foundation of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (coming up in section 5).\n\n### Coulombs — the unit of electric charge\n\n**Charge** is a fundamental property of matter — as fundamental as mass. Just as mass creates gravitational attraction between objects, charge creates electrical attraction and repulsion. There are two kinds of charge, which we call **positive** and **negative** (arbitrary labels — Benjamin Franklin picked them before anyone knew what was going on inside atoms).\n\nThe key rule: **opposite charges attract, like charges repel.** This force is incredibly strong — roughly 10³⁶ times stronger than gravity at the atomic scale. It's the force that holds atoms together, holds molecules together, and (as we'll see) drives current through circuits.\n\nIn ordinary matter, positive and negative charges are balanced. Every atom has a positive nucleus (protons) surrounded by an equal number of negative electrons, so the atom is electrically neutral. A copper wire sitting on your desk has zero net charge — the protons and electrons cancel out perfectly.\n\nSo where does electricity come from if everything is balanced? **By separating charges.** When you pull electrons away from their atoms (or push them onto other atoms), you create a region with excess negative charge and a region with excess positive charge. Those separated charges desperately want to recombine — the attractive force between them is enormous — and that \"wanting to recombine\" is what drives current through a circuit.\n\nA battery does exactly this: chemical reactions inside it pull electrons off atoms on one terminal and pile them up on the other. One terminal ends up with a surplus of electrons (negative, labeled −) and the other with a deficit (positive, labeled +). Connect a wire between the terminals and the electrons rush back to restore balance — that flow is electric current.\n\nA **coulomb (C)** is the SI unit that measures *how much* charge you have. One coulomb is the charge of approximately 6.242 × 10¹⁸ electrons. That is a staggeringly large number of particles, which is why individual electrons rarely matter in circuit analysis — we always work with enormous crowds of them.\n\nA single electron carries a charge of **−1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C** (negative by convention). Protons carry the same magnitude but positive. In a copper wire carrying 1 amp, roughly 6.2 quintillion electrons pass any point every second.\n\nCharge is conserved — you cannot create or destroy it, only move it around. This conservation principle is the physical foundation of Kirchhoff's Current Law (section 6).\n\n### How a coulomb carries energy\n\nA coulomb is just a *count* of charges — it says nothing about how much energy those charges are carrying. The same coulomb of electrons can carry a little energy or a lot. What determines the energy is **how hard they've been pushed apart**, which is voltage.\n\nThink of it with gravity: a kilogram of water is always a kilogram, whether it's sitting on the ground floor or on the roof of a skyscraper. But the kilogram on the roof has far more potential energy — it was *lifted* higher, and it can do more work when it falls. The mass didn't change; the height did.\n\nVoltage is the electrical equivalent of that height. A coulomb of charge \"lifted\" to 12V carries 12 joules of energy. The same coulomb at 5V carries only 5 joules. The charge is identical — the same number of electrons — but the energy per charge is different because the source (battery, power supply) is doing a different amount of work to separate them.\n\nThis is exactly what the equation $V = W/Q$ says — where *W* is work (measured in joules) and *Q* is charge (measured in coulombs):\n- A 12V battery does **12 joules of work** on every coulomb it pushes through the circuit\n- A 5V USB supply does **5 joules of work** per coulomb\n- A 1.5V AA battery does **1.5 joules of work** per coulomb\n\nThe battery is continuously doing this work — lifting each coulomb as it passes through — and the circuit is continuously spending it. Each charge gains energy as it passes through the battery and loses energy as it flows through components (dropping voltage across each one, converting electrical energy into heat, light, or motion). Both happen simultaneously, like a water pump and a water wheel running together. By the time a charge returns to the negative terminal, it has spent exactly the energy the battery put in (KVL: the voltage drops sum to zero around the loop).\n\n> **A note on notation:** You'll see two kinds of letters in equations — *variable names* and *unit symbols*. They look similar but mean different things:\n>\n> | What we're measuring | Variable name (in equations) | Unit symbol (after numbers) |\n> |---|---|---|\n> | Energy / work | *W* | J (joules) |\n> | Charge | *Q* | C (coulombs) |\n> | Voltage | *V* | V (volts) |\n> | Current | *I* | A (amperes) |\n> | Time | *t* | s (seconds) |\n>\n> So $V = W / Q$ means \"voltage equals work divided by charge,\" and the units are V = J / C (volts = joules per coulomb). The letter *W* in the equation is **not** watts — it stands for work, which is measured in joules. Confusingly, the *unit* for power is also W (watts), but that's a different context. You can always tell them apart: *W* in an equation is a variable (work/energy); W after a number (like \"0.25 W\") is a unit (watts).\n\n### Why these matter\n\nEvery electrical quantity you will learn is defined in terms of joules and coulombs:\n\n| Quantity | Definition | Equation | Unit |\n|----------|-----------|----------|------|\n| **Voltage** | Energy per unit charge | *V* = *W* / *Q* | V (volts) = J / C |\n| **Current** | Charge flow per unit time | *I* = *Q* / *t* | A (amps) = C / s |\n| **Power** | Energy per unit time | *P* = *W* / *t* | W (watts) = J / s |\n| **Resistance** | Voltage per unit current | *R* = *V* / *I* | Ω (ohms) = V / A |\n\nIf you ever forget what a volt or an amp \"really is,\" come back to this table. Voltage is how much energy each coulomb of charge carries. Current is how many coulombs pass per second. Power is how many joules are delivered per second. Everything else follows from these two building blocks.",

   "source": "---\n## 1. Voltage — Electrical Potential Difference\n\n### Concept\n\nYou'll hear the water analogy everywhere: voltage is like water pressure. It's a decent starting point — a higher reservoir creates more pressure at the tap, just as a higher voltage pushes harder on charges. But let's move past that quickly.\n\n**Voltage is the energy per unit charge between two points.** Its unit is the **volt (V)**, which is one joule per coulomb:\n\n$$V = \\frac{W}{Q} \\quad \\text{(volts = joules / coulombs)}$$\n\n(Remember from section 0: *W* here is the variable for work/energy in joules, *Q* is charge in coulombs.)\n\nKey insight: **voltage is always measured between two points.** When someone says \"this node is at 5V,\" they mean 5V *with respect to ground* (the reference point we call 0V). There is no such thing as the voltage at a single point in isolation.\n\n### The Material Science Why\n\nInside a battery, chemical reactions continuously separate charges. This separation creates an electric field — a force field that pushes positive charges from high potential to low potential. The battery does work (spends chemical energy) to maintain that separation. The voltage you read on the label is how much energy per coulomb the battery delivers to each charge passing through it."

    "In a copper wire, the outer-shell electrons of copper atoms are loosely bound and form a \"sea\" of free electrons. When you apply a voltage across the wire, the resulting electric field nudges these electrons. They don't sprint — their **drift velocity** is only about 0.1 mm/s. But there are *so many* of them (~8.5 × 10²⁸ per m³ in copper) that even a tiny drift produces a large current. The electrical signal itself (the field) propagates at close to the speed of light — that's why the light turns on instantly even though individual electrons barely move."

    "As electrons drift through a conductor, they collide with the lattice of atoms. Each collision transfers kinetic energy to the lattice (which is why resistors heat up). Materials with tightly packed lattices or fewer free carriers have higher resistance. Temperature generally increases resistance in metals (more atomic vibration → more collisions) but *decreases* it in semiconductors (more thermal energy frees more carriers). This distinction will matter enormously when we get to diodes and transistors."

    "## 7. Voltage Dividers — The Most Important Circuit You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A voltage divider is two resistors in series. The voltage at the midpoint is a fraction of the input voltage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    V_in ----[ R1 ]----+---- V_out\n",
    "                       |\n",
    "                      [ R2 ]\n",
    "                       |\n",
    "                      GND\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Voltage dividers show up *everywhere*:\n",
    "- Biasing transistors\n",
    "- Setting reference voltages\n",
    "- Reading sensors (thermistors, photoresistors, etc.)\n",
    "- Feedback networks in op-amps and voltage regulators\n",
    "- ADC input scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical caveat:** The formula above only works when the load connected to V_out draws negligible current. If you connect a low-impedance load, it acts as a resistor in parallel with R2, and the output voltage drops. This is the #1 mistake beginners make with voltage dividers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasheet Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Many voltage regulators (like the LM317) use a voltage divider on the output to set the regulated voltage. The datasheet gives you the formula and tells you which resistor values to use. Potentiometers are also variable voltage dividers — their datasheets specify total resistance and taper (linear vs logarithmic)."

    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **IMPORTANT:** Move the red probe to the **mA/A** jack on the Klein MM300. Set the dial to DC mA.\n",
    "2. Wire the multimeter IN SERIES with the resistor (the current must flow *through* the meter).\n",
    "3. Apply 5V from the bench supply.\n",
    "4. Read the current.\n",

    "**Expected:** $I = 5\\text{V} / 1000\\text{Ω} = 5.0\\text{mA}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common mistake:** Connecting the multimeter in **parallel** while in current mode. This creates a near-short-circuit through the meter's low internal resistance and can blow the meter's fuse. Always double-check your connections before applying power."
