    "## 0. The Two Quantities You Need First: Energy and Charge\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we define voltage, current, or anything else, we need two physical quantities that everything else is built from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joules — the unit of energy\n",
    "\n",
    "A **joule (J)** is the SI unit of energy. One joule is the energy needed to:\n",
    "- Lift a 100g apple about 1 meter against gravity\n",
    "- Light a 1W LED for 1 second\n",
    "- Push 1 ampere of current through 1 ohm of resistance for 1 second\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy is the capacity to do work — to move something, heat something, or emit light. In electronics, energy is what a battery stores and what components consume. A AA battery holds roughly 9,000 joules. A lightning bolt delivers about 1 billion joules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: **energy is conserved.** It cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. A battery converts chemical energy to electrical energy. A resistor converts electrical energy to heat. An LED converts it to light. This conservation principle is the physical foundation of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (coming up in section 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coulombs — the unit of electric charge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charge** is a fundamental property of matter — as fundamental as mass. Just as mass creates gravitational attraction between objects, charge creates electrical attraction and repulsion. There are two kinds of charge, which we call **positive** and **negative** (arbitrary labels — Benjamin Franklin picked them before anyone knew what was going on inside atoms).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key rule: **opposite charges attract, like charges repel.** This force is incredibly strong — roughly 10³⁶ times stronger than gravity at the atomic scale. It's the force that holds atoms together, holds molecules together, and (as we'll see) drives current through circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordinary matter, positive and negative charges are balanced. Every atom has a positive nucleus (protons) surrounded by an equal number of negative electrons, so the atom is electrically neutral. A copper wire sitting on your desk has zero net charge — the protons and electrons cancel out perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does electricity come from if everything is balanced? **By separating charges.** When you pull electrons away from their atoms (or push them onto other atoms), you create a region with excess negative charge and a region with excess positive charge. Those separated charges desperately want to recombine — the attractive force between them is enormous — and that \"wanting to recombine\" is what drives current through a circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A battery does exactly this: chemical reactions inside it pull electrons off atoms on one terminal and pile them up on the other. One terminal ends up with a surplus of electrons (negative, labeled −) and the other with a deficit (positive, labeled +). Connect a wire between the terminals and the electrons rush back to restore balance — that flow is electric current.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **coulomb (C)** is the SI unit that measures *how much* charge you have. One coulomb is the charge of approximately 6.242 × 10¹⁸ electrons. That is a staggeringly large number of particles, which is why individual electrons rarely matter in circuit analysis — we always work with enormous crowds of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single electron carries a charge of **−1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C** (negative by convention). Protons carry the same magnitude but positive. In a copper wire carrying 1 amp, roughly 6.2 quintillion electrons pass any point every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charge is conserved — you cannot create or destroy it, only move it around. This conservation principle is the physical foundation of Kirchhoff's Current Law (section 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How a coulomb carries energy\n",
    "\n",
    "A coulomb is just a *count* of charges — it says nothing about how much energy those charges are carrying. The same coulomb of electrons can carry a little energy or a lot. What determines the energy is **how hard they've been pushed apart**, which is voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it with gravity: a kilogram of water is always a kilogram, whether it's sitting on the ground floor or on the roof of a skyscraper. But the kilogram on the roof has far more potential energy — it was *lifted* higher, and it can do more work when it falls. The mass didn't change; the height did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage is the electrical equivalent of that height. A coulomb of charge \"lifted\" to 12V carries 12 joules of energy. The same coulomb at 5V carries only 5 joules. The charge is identical — the same number of electrons — but the energy per charge is different because the source (battery, power supply) is doing a different amount of work to separate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what the equation $V = W/Q$ says — where *W* is work (measured in joules) and *Q* is charge (measured in coulombs):\n",
    "- A 12V battery does **12 joules of work** on every coulomb it pushes through the circuit\n",
    "- A 5V USB supply does **5 joules of work** per coulomb\n",
    "- A 1.5V AA battery does **1.5 joules of work** per coulomb\n",
    "\n",
    "The battery is continuously doing this work — lifting each coulomb as it passes through — and the circuit is continuously spending it. Each charge gains energy as it passes through the battery and loses energy as it flows through components (dropping voltage across each one, converting electrical energy into heat, light, or motion). Both happen simultaneously, like a water pump and a water wheel running together. By the time a charge returns to the negative terminal, it has spent exactly the energy the battery put in (KVL: the voltage drops sum to zero around the loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A note on notation:** You'll see two kinds of letters in equations — *variable names* and *unit symbols*. They look similar but mean different things:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> | What we're measuring | Variable name (in equations) | Unit symbol (after numbers) |\n",
    "> |---|---|---|\n",
    "> | Energy / work | *W* | J (joules) |\n",
    "> | Charge | *Q* | C (coulombs) |\n",
    "> | Voltage | *V* | V (volts) |\n",
    "> | Current | *I* | A (amperes) |\n",
    "> | Time | *t* | s (seconds) |\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So $V = W / Q$ means \"voltage equals work divided by charge,\" and the units are V = J / C (volts = joules per coulomb). The letter *W* in the equation is **not** watts — it stands for work, which is measured in joules. Confusingly, the *unit* for power is also W (watts), but that's a different context. You can always tell them apart: *W* in an equation is a variable (work/energy); W after a number (like \"0.25 W\") is a unit (watts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why these matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Every electrical quantity you will learn is defined in terms of joules and coulombs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Quantity | Definition | Equation | Unit |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|----------|------|\n",
    "| **Voltage** | Energy per unit charge | *V* = *W* / *Q* | V (volts) = J / C |\n",
    "| **Current** | Charge flow per unit time | *I* = *Q* / *t* | A (amps) = C / s |\n",
    "| **Power** | Energy per unit time | *P* = *W* / *t* | W (watts) = J / s |\n",
    "| **Resistance** | Voltage per unit current | *R* = *V* / *I* | Ω (ohms) = V / A |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever forget what a volt or an amp \"really is,\" come back to this table. Voltage is how much energy each coulomb of charge carries. Current is how many coulombs pass per second. Power is how many joules are delivered per second. Everything else follows from these two building blocks."

    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll hear the water analogy everywhere: voltage is like water pressure. It's a decent starting point — a higher reservoir creates more pressure at the tap, just as a higher voltage pushes harder on charges. But let's move past that quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Voltage is the energy per unit charge between two points.** Its unit is the **volt (V)**, which is one joule per coulomb:\n",

    "$$V = \\frac{W}{Q} \\quad \\text{(volts = joules / coulombs)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Remember from section 0: *W* here is the variable for work/energy in joules, *Q* is charge in coulombs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insight: **voltage is always measured between two points.** When someone says \"this node is at 5V,\" they mean 5V *with respect to ground* (the reference point we call 0V). There is no such thing as the voltage at a single point in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Material Science Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a battery, chemical reactions continuously separate charges. This separation creates an **electric field** — and since we'll use this term a lot, let's unpack it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a field?** A field is a way of describing a force that acts across empty space — \"action at a distance.\" Gravity is the most familiar example: the Earth creates a gravitational field that extends outward in all directions, getting weaker with distance. You can't see the field, but you know it's there because anything with mass placed within it feels a pull. You don't need a rope connecting the apple to the Earth — the field itself transmits the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **electric field** works the same way, but for charge instead of mass. Any charged object creates an electric field that extends outward through the surrounding space. Place another charge in that field and it feels a force — attraction if the charges are opposite, repulsion if they're the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where does it exist?** The field exists in the space between and around the charges. In a circuit, that means it fills the wire, the air around the wire, and even the gaps between components. When a battery separates charges (piling up electrons on one terminal and leaving a deficit on the other), the resulting field extends through the wire connected to those terminals. It's this field — existing *inside the wire itself* — that pushes the free electrons along and creates current.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it propagate?** When you flip a switch, the field doesn't crawl through the wire at electron-speed. Changes to the electric field propagate at close to the speed of light (~2/3 the speed of light in copper wire, specifically). That's why a light turns on instantly even though individual electrons barely move — the field establishes itself almost everywhere at once, and every free electron in the wire starts drifting simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How deep does this go?** Pretty deep. The electric field is one half of the **electromagnetic field** — the other half is the magnetic field, and the two are intimately linked (changing one creates the other, which is how light works). The full description is Maxwell's equations, one of the most successful theories in all of physics. For circuit analysis, you don't need Maxwell's equations — thinking of the field as \"the force that voltage exerts on charges through space\" is sufficient and accurate. If you want to go deeper, Griffiths' *Introduction to Electrodynamics* is the standard reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The battery does work (spends chemical energy) to maintain the charge separation, which maintains the field. The voltage you read on the label is how much energy per coulomb the battery delivers to each charge passing through it."

    "## 2. Current — Charge in Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current is the rate at which charge flows past a point.** Its unit is the **ampere (A)**, which is one coulomb per second:\n",

    "$$I = \\frac{Q}{t} \\quad \\text{(amps = coulombs / seconds)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventional current** flows from + to −. **Electron flow** goes the other way (− to +). We use conventional current in circuit analysis, and here's the story of why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benjamin Franklin, experimenting with static electricity in the 1740s, needed to pick a direction for current flow. He had no way to know what was physically moving inside a wire, so he guessed: he called the charge that seemed to flow from glass (rubbed with silk) \"positive,\" and declared that current flows from + to −. He had a 50/50 shot. He got it backwards — 150 years later, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron and showed that in metals, it's the *negative* charges that actually move, in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the thing: **it doesn't matter for circuit analysis.** A positive charge moving left is electrically identical to a negative charge moving right — they produce the same current, the same magnetic field, the same voltage drops. The math works out the same either way. So the convention stuck. Every circuit diagram, every datasheet, every textbook uses conventional current (+ to −) unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's a twist that will matter for this course: Franklin's \"wrong\" convention turns out to be **half-right in semiconductors.** In silicon, there are two types of charge carriers — electrons (negative) and **holes** (effectively positive, moving in the conventional current direction). We'll meet holes in Module 02, but for now just know that conventional current isn't as arbitrary as it first seems. In semiconductors, positive carriers really do flow from + to −.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Material Science Why\n",
    "\n",
    "In a copper wire, the outer-shell electrons of copper atoms are loosely bound and form a \"sea\" of free electrons. When you connect a battery, its electric field extends through the wire at close to the speed of light (as we saw in section 1). That field nudges every free electron in the wire simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrons don't sprint — their **drift velocity** is only about 0.1 mm/s. But there are *so many* of them (~8.5 × 10²⁸ per m³ in copper) that even a tiny drift produces a large current. Think of it like a pipe completely filled with marbles: push one in at one end and one immediately pops out the other end. The signal (the field) travels at the speed of light; the individual electrons barely move.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Inside the battery itself**, it's a different story. The charge carriers aren't free electrons — they're **ions** (atoms that have gained or lost electrons) moving through a chemical electrolyte. And the positive ions actually *do* move in the conventional current direction, from + to −. So conventional current is only \"backwards\" in metals. In electrolytes, plasmas, and semiconductors, positive carriers are real."

Unit: **ohm (Ω)**.\n\n**Ohm's Law** — the single most important equation in electronics:\n\n$$V = I \\cdot R$$\n\nRearranged:\n- $I = V / R$ — more voltage or less resistance means more current\n- $R = V / I$ — measure V and I to find R\n\n**Worked example:** A 1kΩ resistor is connected across a 5V supply.  \n$I = V / R = 5\\text{V} / 1000\\text{Ω} = 5\\text{mA}$\n\n### The Material Science Why\n\nAs charge carriers drift through a material, they collide with the lattice of atoms. Each collision transfers kinetic energy to the lattice (which is why resistors heat up). The more collisions per second, the higher the resistance.\n\nIn the copper wires and metal-film resistors on your breadboard, the charge carriers are **free electrons** — as we saw in section 2. But remember: electrons aren't the only kind of charge carrier. Inside a battery, the carriers are ions. In semiconductors, they're electrons *and* holes. What matters for resistance is not *which* carriers are moving, but **how many** there are and **how easily** they can move through the material.\n\nThis leads to a key difference between metals and semiconductors:\n- **Metals:** plenty of free electrons, so resistance is low. Heating the metal makes the atomic lattice vibrate more, causing more collisions, so **resistance goes up** with temperature.\n- **Semiconductors:** very few free carriers at room temperature, so resistance is high. But heating the material frees more carriers (knocks more electrons loose from the lattice), so **resistance goes down** with temperature — the extra carriers more than compensate for the extra vibration.\n\nThis distinction will matter enormously when we get to diodes and transistors. A semiconductor's resistance isn't fixed — it depends on temperature, doping (intentionally added impurities), and applied voltage. That's what makes semiconductors useful: their conductivity can be *controlled*."

    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A voltage divider is two resistors in series. The voltage at the midpoint is a fraction of the input voltage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "                      [ R2 ]\n",
    "                       |\n",
    "                      GND\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Voltage dividers show up *everywhere*:\n",
    "- Biasing transistors\n",
    "- Setting reference voltages\n",
    "- Reading sensors (thermistors, photoresistors, etc.)\n",
    "- Feedback networks in op-amps and voltage regulators\n",
    "- ADC input scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical caveat:** The formula above only works when the load connected to V_out draws negligible current. If you connect a low-impedance load, it acts as a resistor in parallel with R2, and the output voltage drops. This is the #1 mistake beginners make with voltage dividers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasheet Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Many voltage regulators (like the LM317) use a voltage divider on the output to set the regulated voltage. The datasheet gives you the formula and tells you which resistor values to use. Potentiometers are also variable voltage dividers — their datasheets specify total resistance and taper (linear vs logarithmic)."

    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A current limiting resistor restricts the maximum current that can flow through a component — most commonly an LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LED example:** A typical red LED has a forward voltage of ~2V and a maximum continuous current of 20mA. With a 5V supply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{V_{\\text{supply}} - V_{\\text{LED}}}{I_{\\text{LED}}} = \\frac{5 - 2}{0.020} = 150\\Omega$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice you'd use 220Ω or 330Ω for a comfortable margin and slightly dimmer (but longer-lasting) LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not just connect the LED directly?** Without the resistor, the LED's low forward resistance means near-infinite current flows — the LED dies instantly. The resistor absorbs the excess voltage and limits current to a safe value.\n",

    "### Datasheet Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "LED datasheets specify:\n",
    "- **Forward voltage (V_f):** typically 1.8–3.3V depending on color\n",
    "- **Maximum forward current (I_f):** typically 20mA for standard LEDs\n",
