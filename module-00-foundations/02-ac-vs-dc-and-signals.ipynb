    "### The Material Science Why — Rise Time, Capacitance, and Inductance\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect square wave would require truly instantaneous voltage transitions from low to high and back. In reality, real square waves always have **rise time** and **fall time**: the edges are slightly sloped rather than perfectly vertical. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer involves two physical phenomena we haven't encountered yet: **capacitance** and **inductance**. Both are fundamental to how circuits behave, especially with changing signals. Here is a first look at each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Capacitance: resistance to voltage change\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacitance** is the ability of a structure to store energy in an **electric field**. Any time you have two conductors separated by an insulator (even a tiny air gap), you have capacitance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to think about it: imagine a stretchable rubber membrane across a water pipe. Water pressure (voltage) can push the membrane and store energy in its tension, but the membrane takes time to stretch. You can't change the pressure instantly — the membrane absorbs the change gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a circuit, capacitance means **voltage cannot change instantaneously**. Charge must flow onto the conductors to build up the electric field, and that takes time. The more capacitance, the longer it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **capacitor** is a component designed to have a specific, useful amount of capacitance. But capacitance also exists where you don't want it — between adjacent wires, between circuit board traces, even between layers inside a chip. This unintentional capacitance is called **parasitic capacitance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductance: resistance to current change\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductance** is the ability of a structure to store energy in a **magnetic field**. Any conductor carrying current creates a magnetic field around it. Changing the current means changing the field, and the field pushes back against the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a heavy flywheel connected to a water pump. Once water is flowing, the flywheel's momentum keeps it going — you can't stop the flow instantly. And if the water is still, the flywheel's inertia resists starting the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a circuit, inductance means **current cannot change instantaneously**. The magnetic field stores energy that resists changes in current flow. The more inductance, the stronger the resistance to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **inductor** is a component designed to have a specific inductance (usually a coil of wire). But every straight wire also has a small amount of **parasitic inductance** simply because it carries current and creates a magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this limits rise time\n",
    "\n",
    "When a square wave tries to transition from low to high:\n",
    "- **Parasitic capacitance** must be charged up — voltage can't jump instantly\n",
    "- **Parasitic inductance** resists the sudden change in current needed to charge that capacitance\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they turn a theoretically instantaneous edge into a sloped transition that takes real time. The sharper the edges you need, the faster your circuit and measurement equipment need to be able to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A note on \"bandwidth\":** In electronics, **bandwidth** means the range of frequencies a circuit or instrument can handle. An oscilloscope with \"100 MHz bandwidth\" can accurately display signals up to 100 million cycles per second. This is related to — but different from — everyday uses of the word. Internet \"bandwidth\" (how much data per second) borrowed the term from electronics, and \"personal bandwidth\" borrowed it from there. The original meaning is about frequency range: a circuit with more bandwidth can handle faster-changing signals, which is exactly what sharp square wave edges require.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Going deeper:** Capacitance and inductance are central to AC circuit analysis. They combine with resistance to form **impedance** — a concept we'll develop through the course as we encounter filters, bypass capacitors, oscillator circuits, and switching transients. For now, the key intuition is: capacitance resists voltage changes, inductance resists current changes, and both are present even when you haven't added any components."

    "## 5. RMS Voltage — Why Your Multimeter Reads a Different Number\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You connect a sine wave to a resistor. The voltage swings positive, then negative, then positive again. Over one full cycle, the **average voltage is exactly zero** — the positive and negative halves cancel perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the resistor is clearly getting hot. Energy is being delivered. So the average voltage is useless for describing how much power an AC signal delivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a single number that answers the question: **\"What DC voltage would heat this resistor by the same amount?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop and think:** If you were going to invent a way to calculate this, how would you do it? You need a method that captures the \"size\" of the waveform without letting the positive and negative halves cancel. And it needs to relate to power, not just voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Think about it for a moment, then read on.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### First attempt: area under the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first instinct might be: just ignore the sign. Take the **average of the absolute value** of the voltage — the \"area under the curve\" divided by the period. For a sine wave with a peak of 1V, this gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2 \\times V_{\\text{peak}}}{\\pi} \\approx 0.637 \\times V_{\\text{peak}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfectly valid number, and some meters actually measure this way internally. But here's the problem: **it doesn't correspond to power delivery.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not? Because power isn't proportional to voltage — it's proportional to voltage **squared**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\frac{V^2}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means a moment where the voltage is 2V doesn't deliver twice the power of a moment at 1V — it delivers **four times** the power. The peaks of the sine wave contribute disproportionately more heating than the parts near zero. A simple average of |V| doesn't capture this — it treats 2V as only twice as important as 1V, when for power purposes it's four times as important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why squaring is the right move\n",
    "\n",
    "Since power depends on V², the correct question is: **what is the average power delivered over one cycle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\frac{v(t)^2}{R} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{R} \\times \\overline{v^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{v^2}$ is the mean of the squared voltage. Now we can find the equivalent DC voltage: the DC voltage that delivers this same average power must satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_{\\text{DC}}^2}{R} = \\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{DC}} = \\sqrt{\\overline{v^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the **Root** of the **Mean** of the **Square** — RMS. The squaring isn't a trick to avoid cancellation (though it does that too). It's there because **power depends on V²**, so averaging V² is what gives you average power. The square root at the end just converts back to voltage units.\n",

    "### The name, decoded\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMS** stands for **Root Mean Square**, and it describes the procedure in reverse order:\n",

    "1. **Square** every instantaneous voltage value — this gives instantaneous power (times 1/R)\n",
    "2. **Mean** — average those squared values over one complete cycle — this gives average power (times 1/R)\n",
    "3. **Root** — take the square root to get back to voltage units\n",
    "\n",
    "### The formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **sine wave:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 \\times V_{\\text{peak}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{\\text{peak}} = V_{\\text{rms}} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\times V_{\\text{rms}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why 120V mains actually peaks at ~170V.** The \"120V\" is the RMS value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other waveforms, the RMS relationship is different because the shape of the curve changes how the squared values average out:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Waveform | V_rms / V_peak | Why |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|-----|\n",
    "| Sine | $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$ | Spends most time near zero, less time at peaks |\n",
    "| Square | $1.000$ | Always at peak — squaring changes nothing |\n",
    "| Triangle | $1/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.577$ | Linear ramps spend even more time near zero than sine |\n",
    "\n",
    "A square wave's RMS equals its peak because the voltage is *always* at maximum magnitude — there's nothing to average away. A triangle wave has the lowest RMS-to-peak ratio because it spends so much time at low voltages ramping up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important for measurements:** Most multimeters (including the Klein MM300) measure **average-responding, RMS-calibrated** AC voltage. This means they internally measure the average of |V| (the \"area under the curve\" method), then multiply by a correction factor that converts to RMS — but only correctly **for sine waves.** For square or triangle waves, the correction factor is wrong and the reading will be off. A **True RMS** multimeter actually computes V² internally and gives the correct answer for any waveform shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasheet Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "AC voltage ratings on components (capacitors, transformers, power supplies) are almost always in RMS unless stated otherwise. A capacitor rated for \"25V AC\" means 25V RMS — the actual peak voltage it sees is 35.4V. Always check whether a datasheet specifies peak or RMS."

    "- **Sine** waves\n",
    "- **Square** waves (with adjustable duty cycle)\n",
    "- **Triangle** waves\n",
    "- **Sawtooth** waves\n",
    "- Arbitrary waveforms (depending on firmware)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parameters you can set:**\n",
    "- **Frequency:** How many cycles per second (Hz, kHz, MHz)\n",
    "- **Amplitude:** The height of the waveform (max 3.0V on the Fnirsi 2C53T)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Watch out — \"amplitude\" means different things.** In physics and math, **amplitude** means the peak deviation from the center — for a bipolar sine wave, it's the distance from 0V to the peak. On the Fnirsi, \"Amplitude\" means **trough-to-peak** (what a physicist would call $V_{pp}$). Setting \"Amplitude: 3V\" on the Fnirsi produces a 0V-to-3V signal, not a ±3V signal. Neither convention is wrong — but you need to know which one your equipment uses. Datasheets and textbooks almost always mean center-to-peak; signal generators vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal generator outputs through the **signal output** BNC connector. Connect this to your oscilloscope input with a BNC cable to observe the generated signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Starting/stopping signal generation on the Fnirsi 2C53T:** In signal generator mode, look for the small signal icon in the upper left — **green background** means the signal is being generated, **red** means it's off. To toggle: **long-press** the blue central ⏸️▶️ button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unipolar vs Bipolar Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fnirsi 2C53T generates signals that swing from **0V to the amplitude setting**. Setting \"Amplitude: 3V\" produces a signal from 0V to 3V — the voltage is always positive. This is called a **unipolar** signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A textbook signal generator typically produces **bipolar** signals that swing symmetrically around 0V. Setting \"3V amplitude\" on a lab-grade generator would produce a signal from -3V to +3V.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't just two ways of generating the same thing — they represent genuinely different types of signals found in real circuits:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unipolar signals (0V to V_high)** — what the Fnirsi produces:\n",
    "- **Digital logic.** A 3.3V microcontroller output swings between 0V (logic LOW) and 3.3V (logic HIGH). It never goes negative.\n",
    "- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).** Motor controllers, LED dimmers, and power converters use unipolar square waves — the signal is either ON (positive voltage) or OFF (0V).\n",
    "- **Sensor outputs.** Many sensors output 0V to some reference voltage (e.g., 0–5V proportional to temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bipolar signals (−V to +V, centered on 0V):**\n",
    "- **AC mains power.** Wall outlet voltage swings from -170V to +170V (in the US), centered on 0V. Current flows in both directions.\n",
    "- **Audio.** Sound waves are pressure variations above and below atmospheric pressure. The electrical signal representing them swings above and below 0V.\n",
    "- **Radio and communications.** RF signals oscillate symmetrically around 0V.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference: a unipolar signal has a **DC component** (its average is not zero), while a bipolar signal centered on 0V has **no DC component** (the positive and negative halves cancel). This matters for measurement — an AC multimeter is designed to measure the AC component of a signal. If the signal also has DC content (as unipolar signals do), the meter may or may not handle that correctly depending on its internal design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this affects your measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Fnirsi outputs unipolar signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DC coupling on the oscilloscope:** The waveform sits above the 0V line — troughs at 0V, peaks at the amplitude setting. Set the trigger level **between 0V and the amplitude** to get a stable display.\n",
    "- **AC coupling on the oscilloscope:** The scope removes the DC offset, centering the waveform around 0V — troughs go negative, peaks go positive. You can trigger at **0V, rising edge** for a clean view. This is what the signal would look like if it were bipolar.\n",
    "- **V_pp is the same in both modes** — only the position on screen changes.\n",
    "- **Multimeter (AC mode):** Results depend on whether the meter internally blocks DC. See Experiment 4 for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasheet Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal generators are essential for testing circuits. When a component datasheet shows a \"frequency response\" curve, it was measured by sweeping a signal generator across frequencies and recording the output. **You'll do exactly this when characterizing filters and amplifiers later in the course**."

    "7. Switch to **AC coupling** — the line should jump to 0V (the DC is blocked).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Fnirsi outputs a **unipolar** signal (0V to 3V), which is really a 1.5V DC offset with a ±1.5V AC component on top. The MM300 in AC mode is designed to measure AC signals — but how it handles the DC component determines what you see:\n",

    "- Square: V_rms = 1.5V (a square wave's RMS equals its peak)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your readings are significantly higher than these values, the meter is not fully separating the DC and AC components. This isn't a broken meter — it's a meter being given a signal it wasn't designed for. AC multimeters assume **bipolar** input (centered on 0V, like mains power or audio). The Fnirsi's unipolar output violates that assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The takeaway isn't that the meter is wrong** — it's that measurement tools have assumptions built into them, and you need to know what those assumptions are. An oscilloscope shows you the raw truth. A multimeter interprets the signal through a specific model (bipolar AC sine wave), and when the signal doesn't fit that model, the interpretation breaks down. Recognizing when your tools' assumptions are violated is a fundamental skill in electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- The oscilloscope shows you the true waveform shape and voltage — trust it\n",
    "- The multimeter gives a single-number summary that depends on built-in assumptions about the signal\n",
    "- Unipolar signals (like the Fnirsi's output, or digital logic) have DC content that confuses AC meters\n",
    "- Bipolar signals (like mains power or audio) are what AC meters are calibrated for\n",
    "- A **True RMS** meter handles non-sine waveforms correctly, but still expects properly AC-coupled input"
