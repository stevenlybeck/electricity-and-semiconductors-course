    "\n",
    "Bonus Lab 00 showed how AC coupling works: a series capacitor blocks DC, a resistor to ground sets the output at 0V, and the AC signal rides on top. The Fnirsi's 0–3V unipolar output becomes a ±1.5V bipolar signal.\n",

    "But **0V isn't always where you want the signal.** What if you need it centered on 2.5V? Or 1.65V?\n",
    "\n",
    "This comes up constantly in electronics:\n",
    "- **ADC input conditioning:** A 0–3.3V sensor output needs to be centered at 1.65V for a differential ADC\n",
    "- **Amplifier biasing:** Each transistor amplifier stage needs its input at a specific DC voltage to operate in its linear region\n",
    "- **Level shifting:** Interfacing between circuits that run at different supply voltages\n",
    "\n",
    "A capacitor alone can only *remove* DC — it can't create a voltage from nothing. To *set* a new DC level, you need a DC source. The simplest DC source is a **resistor divider** connected to a supply rail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipe: **AC-couple (strip the old DC), then re-bias with a resistor divider (set the new DC).** The AC signal rides on top of whatever DC level the divider establishes."

    "\n",
    "There's a completely different approach to DC level shifting: the **clamper** circuit (also called a DC restorer).\n",

    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the **negative half-cycle**, the diode conducts. Current flows through the diode and charges the capacitor.\n",
    "2. The capacitor charges until the negative peak of the output just reaches the diode's threshold (≈0V for an ideal diode, or −0.6V for a silicon diode).\n",
    "3. On the **positive half-cycle**, the diode is reverse-biased. No current flows. The capacitor holds its charge.\n",
    "4. The result: the entire waveform is shifted so that the negative peak sits at the clamping voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference from the divider approach:**\n",
    "- **Divider re-bias:** The bias voltage is *fixed* by the divider ratio. The AC signal rides on top. Works regardless of the AC amplitude.\n",
    "- **Clamper:** The shift depends on the AC amplitude. It always puts one *peak* at the reference voltage. Change the amplitude and the DC shift changes too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you see clampers:\n",
    "- **CRT black level restoration:** Clamps the video signal so that \"black\" is always at a known voltage, regardless of image content\n",
    "- **ESD protection:** Clamping diodes prevent voltages from exceeding supply rails\n",
    "- **Charge pumps:** Use clamping action to generate voltages higher than the supply"

The AC signal hops from stage to stage through the caps, picking up a new DC level at each one. A 4-stage amplifier has 3 coupling capacitors (between stages 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4).\n",

    "**Op-amp single-supply circuits.** Op-amps ideally want their inputs at mid-supply. In single-supply designs (0V and +5V, no negative rail), a resistor divider creates a \"virtual ground\" at 2.5V. The AC signal is referenced to this mid-rail instead of true ground."

    "**Q1:** You have a 0–5V square wave and need it centered on 1.5V. What DC level does the divider need to provide? What's the output voltage range?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** Your divider uses 1kΩ resistors and the signal source has a 10kΩ output impedance driving a 1µF coupling cap. Will the AC signal be attenuated significantly at 1 kHz? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** A clamper clamps the negative peak to 0V. If the input is a ±2V sine, what's the output voltage range?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4:** Why can't a capacitor alone *add* a DC offset to a signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5:** An audio amplifier has 4 gain stages, each biased at 4.5V from a 9V supply. How many coupling capacitors are there between stages?"
