    "## 1. The Problem We're Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 00, Experiment 4, we discovered something frustrating: the Klein MM300 multimeter gave incorrect AC voltage readings for the Fnirsi's output. The readings were too high because the Fnirsi generates **unipolar** signals (0V to 3V) and the multimeter expects **bipolar** signals (centered on 0V).\n",
    "\n",
    "The oscilloscope's **AC coupling** mode fixed the *display* — switching to AC coupling removed the DC offset and centered the waveform on 0V. But that only changed what the scope showed. The signal itself was still unipolar.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could build a circuit that actually *converts* the signal from unipolar to bipolar? Then we could feed the converted signal to the multimeter and get correct readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can. The oscilloscope's AC coupling mode is just a capacitor and a resistor. We can build the same thing on a breadboard."

    "## 2. What AC Coupling Actually Is — The Full Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 00 we defined **coupling** as how one stage connects to the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DC coupling** = a direct wire. Everything passes through — DC and AC alike.\n",
    "- **AC coupling** = a series capacitor that blocks DC and passes AC.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's what we didn't cover: **the capacitor alone isn't the whole story.** A capacitor in series blocks DC from flowing *through* the connection, but the output side still needs to know what voltage to sit at when there's no signal. It needs a **DC reference** — a path to some known voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside your oscilloscope, that reference is the **1MΩ input impedance** — a very high-value resistor from the input to ground that's always there. It pulls the DC level of the AC-coupled input to 0V.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a breadboard, we add that resistor ourselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **C (series capacitor):** Blocks the DC component, passes the AC component.\n",
    "- **R (resistor to ground):** Sets the DC operating point of the output to 0V. Without it, the output node would float at an undefined voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these two components form what's called a **high-pass filter** — it passes high frequencies (AC) and blocks low frequencies (DC is the ultimate low frequency: 0 Hz). We'll explore the filtering behavior later, but first let's understand *why* this works."

    "## 3. Why the Capacitor Blocks DC\n",
    "\n",
    "A capacitor is two conductors separated by an insulator. No current can flow *through* the insulator — electrons can't cross the gap. But current can flow *in and out of* the capacitor as it charges and discharges.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the voltage across a capacitor is **changing**, charge flows onto one plate and off the other — current flows in the external circuit. When the voltage is **constant** (DC), the capacitor is fully charged and current stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key intuition:\n",
    "- **DC (constant voltage):** Capacitor charges up, current stops. DC is blocked.\n",
    "- **AC (changing voltage):** Capacitor is constantly charging and discharging. Current flows continuously. AC passes through.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens with the Fnirsi's unipolar signal\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fnirsi outputs a 0V-to-3V sine wave. This is really a **1.5V DC offset** with a **±1.5V AC component** riding on top:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{in}(t) = \\underbrace{1.5\\text{V}}_{\\text{DC}} + \\underbrace{1.5\\text{V} \\cdot \\sin(2\\pi f t)}_{\\text{AC}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When this hits the series capacitor:\n",
    "1. The capacitor charges up to the **average (DC) value** of the input: 1.5V.\n",
    "2. Once charged, only the **deviations from that average** — the AC component — appear on the output side.\n",
    "3. The resistor to ground pulls the output's DC level to 0V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: the output swings ±1.5V around 0V. **Bipolar.** Exactly what the multimeter expects."

    "**The output node has no DC path to ground.** It's floating. In theory, the DC voltage at Node A is undefined — it could be anything. In practice, it drifts slowly based on tiny leakage currents through the capacitor's insulator, the oscilloscope's input, and even the air.\n",

A coupling capacitor between stages passes the audio signal while blocking one stage's DC bias from disturbing the next. Every guitar amp, PA system, and headphone amplifier has these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your oscilloscope's AC coupling mode.** Literally this circuit: a capacitor in series with the input, and the scope's 1MΩ input impedance as R. Now you know why there's a brief settling time when you switch from DC to AC coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio jacks and cables.** Many audio outputs include a series capacitor to block DC. This prevents damage if the output is accidentally shorted and ensures that no DC offset reaches the headphones or speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-speed digital links.** USB 3.0, PCIe, SATA, and Ethernet all use AC coupling at the physical layer. The same principle — series capacitor, bias resistors on the receiver — running at GHz frequencies with tiny capacitors (100nF or smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasheet connection.** When a datasheet specifies an \"AC-coupled input\" or shows a capacitor on the input in the application circuit, it's telling you that the device's internal circuitry sets its own DC bias point, and you just need to pass the AC signal through. The recommended capacitor value is chosen so that $f_c$ is well below the signal frequency — exactly the design exercise you worked through in this lab."
