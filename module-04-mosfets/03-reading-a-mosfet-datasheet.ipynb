    "1. **The IRFZ44N datasheet says I_D = 49A.** Can you actually run 49A through it on your breadboard? Why or why not?\n",

    "5. **The gate charge Q_g = 63 nC.** You want to switch at 500 kHz. Calculate: (a) Required gate driver current for 50 ns switching. (b) Gate drive power loss.\n",

    "8. **Design problem:** You need to switch a 24V, 20A load. Check if the IRFZ44N is suitable. What V_GS will you use? What heatsink R_θSA is needed to keep T_J < 125°C at T_A = 40°C?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answers:*\n",
    "1. *No! That rating assumes T_C = 25°C (massive heatsink). Without heatsink, R_θJA = 62°C/W limits you to ~2.4W → ~11A max. On a breadboard, even less.*\n",
    "2. *At V_GS = 5V, R_DS(on) is ~45 mΩ (2.5x worse). Solutions: (a) Use a gate driver to boost to 10V, or (b) use a logic-level MOSFET (IRLZ44N, IRLB8721).*\n",
    "3. *P_D = 10² × 0.024 (max) = 2.4W. T_J = 50 + 2.4 × 62 = 199°C. Way above 175°C limit — NOT safe! Need a heatsink.*\n",
    "4. *R_DS(on) is slightly current-dependent due to self-heating and channel effects. The test condition defines the measurement point for consistency and comparison between devices.*\n",
    "5. *(a) I_g = 63 nC / 50 ns = 1.26 A peak. (b) P_gate = 63 nC × 10V × 500 kHz = 315 mW.*\n",
    "6. *The metal tab is the DRAIN — which carries high voltage! Bolting it to a grounded heatsink shorts the drain to ground. Use an insulating pad (silicone, mica, or Kapton) and insulating shoulder washer on the bolt.*\n",
    "7. *In half-bridge or full-bridge circuits (H-bridges, motor drives) where the body diode conducts during dead time. The 1.3V forward drop causes losses, and the 51 ns reverse recovery can cause shoot-through current spikes.*\n",
    "8. *V_DSS = 55V > 24V (OK, but only 31V margin — watch for inductive spikes!). At 20A: P_D = 20² × 0.024 = 9.6W (cold), maybe 15W hot. For T_J < 125°C: R_θJA = (125-40)/15 = 5.7°C/W. R_θSA = 5.7 - 1.6 - 0.5 = 3.6°C/W. Need a decent heatsink. V_GS = 10V minimum (use 12V gate driver).*"
