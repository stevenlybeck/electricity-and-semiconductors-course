    "The BJT was revolutionary — but it has a fundamental limitation: it needs *continuous base current* to stay on. Every milliamp flowing into the base is wasted energy that does no useful work in your load. The MOSFET flips the script entirely: it's controlled by *voltage*, not current. The gate is physically insulated from the channel by a thin oxide layer, so essentially **zero current flows into the gate at DC**.\n",

    "5. **Why is it dangerous to leave a MOSFET gate pin floating** (not connected to anything)? What could happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the body diode?** In an N-channel MOSFET, which direction does it conduct?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare BJT and MOSFET switching:** The BJT needs continuous base current to stay on. What does the MOSFET need to stay on? (Trick question — think carefully!)\n",

    "*Answers:*\n",
    "1. *The gate oxide (SiO₂) is an insulator. The gate is one plate of a capacitor — no DC path exists.*\n",
    "2. *The minimum V_GS to create an inversion layer (conducting channel) at the silicon surface.*\n",
    "3. *Linear (ohmic) region — V_DS is very small, so power dissipation (I² × R_DS(on)) is minimized.*\n",
    "4. *P-channel — pulling the gate to ground gives full V_GS without needing voltage above V+.*\n",
    "5. *The extreme input impedance means stray charge can put any voltage on the gate — turning it on unexpectedly or exceeding V_GS(max) and destroying the oxide.*\n",
    "6. *A parasitic diode formed by the body-drain PN junction. In N-channel, it conducts from source to drain (when V_DS goes negative).*\n",
    "7. *Just the gate voltage — but it needs NO current to maintain that voltage (just charge on the gate capacitance). Once charged, it stays on with zero input power.*\n",
    "8. *Silicon naturally forms a high-quality oxide (SiO₂) — an excellent insulator. Germanium oxide is water-soluble and mechanically poor.*"
