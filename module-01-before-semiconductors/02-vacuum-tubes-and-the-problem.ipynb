    "Remember from the previous notebook: in a metal, electrons form a \"free electron sea.\" These electrons have thermal energy — they're constantly jiggling around.\n",
    "\n",
    "At room temperature, no electron has enough energy to **escape** the metal surface. The metal's positive atomic cores create an energy barrier called the **work function** (typically 2-5 eV).\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you **heat the metal** to extreme temperatures (1000-2500C):\n",

    "The thermal energy distribution follows the **Boltzmann distribution**. At extreme temperatures, the tail of this distribution extends beyond the work function, and electrons literally **boil off** the metal surface into the vacuum.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Breakthrough\n",

    "**December 16, 1947**: Bardeen and Brattain demonstrated the first **point-contact transistor** using germanium.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two gold contacts pressed into a germanium surface, very close together\n",
    "- A small signal on one contact controlled a larger current through the other\n",

    "Thermionic emission is the release of electrons from a metal surface when heated to high temperatures. The cathode needs to be heated because at room temperature, no electrons have enough thermal energy to overcome the metal's work function (the energy barrier at the surface). At 1000-2500C, the tail of the Boltzmann energy distribution extends beyond the work function, and some electrons \"boil off\" the surface.\n",

    "The heated cathode emits electrons into the vacuum via thermionic emission. If the plate is positive, it attracts these electrons, and current flows. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted electrons back toward the cathode, and no current flows. The plate is cold and does NOT emit electrons (it's not heated), so there is no source of electrons to flow in the reverse direction.\n",

    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid is a wire mesh between the cathode and plate. Since it sits close to the cathode, a small voltage on the grid has a strong influence on the electron flow. A small negative voltage on the grid repels electrons and reduces plate current; a less negative voltage allows more current. Because the grid is close to the cathode (strong electric field), a small grid voltage change causes a large plate current change — this is amplification. The grid draws almost no current itself (electrons pass through the mesh), so the input power is tiny while the output power is large.\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "About 15 tubes per month (30 days / 2 days per failure = 15 failures per month). To maintain 99.9% uptime, you'd need fast replacement, so keeping 15-30 spares on hand is a minimum. In practice, ENIAC had a team of technicians whose full-time job was finding and replacing failed tubes. Each failure required diagnosis time too — finding which of 17,468 tubes failed was itself a significant challenge.\n",

    "Bell Labs was the research arm of AT&T / Bell Telephone Company. Long-distance telephone calls required vacuum tube amplifiers (repeaters) along the phone lines to boost the signal. These tubes consumed enormous power, generated heat, burned out regularly, and required maintenance at every repeater station. A solid-state alternative would be smaller, use less power, last longer, and reduce the cost of the telephone network. This was a direct business need.\n",

    "For a BJT, the closest analog is **hFE (DC current gain)** or **beta**, which describes how much the base current is amplified in the collector circuit. For a MOSFET, the analog is **transconductance (gm)**, which describes how much the drain current changes per volt of gate voltage change. The triode's mu specifically relates plate voltage change to grid voltage change (at constant plate current), making it most analogous to the voltage gain or amplification factor of the device.\n",

    "Vacuum tubes proved that **electronic amplification and switching** were possible and useful. But they also proved that doing it with hot metal in glass envelopes was fundamentally limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transistor does the same job — uses a small signal to control a larger one — but does it with electrons moving through a **solid crystal** instead of through a **vacuum**. No heated cathode. No vacuum. No glass. Just a tiny piece of semiconductor.\n",
